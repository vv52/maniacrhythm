convert main() of csvToMrc to a function to allow repeat conversions

edit loadChart() in Conductor
	read bpm, start delay, etc. from charts
	potentially move to new script(?) loadChart.cs

hold notes!!
	edit MRC to include second float?
	(float1 float2 ch1 ch2 ch3 ch4 /n)
	ie: (0.0 0.5 t f t f) vs (0.0 t f t f)
	add GetKeyUp() checks if float2 > float1

consolidate note*Pressed() methods into notePressed(int noteNum)
	this would be moved into Judgement.cs potentially

implement custom file extension *.mrc for charts(?)

move judgement checks to Judgement.cs(?)

move note spawning to new script(?) noteSpawner.cs

7b mode(?)
	3b (s, d, f) + 1b (g or h) + 3b (j, k, l)

rethink 10b mode -> 8b mode(?)
	6b (s, d, f, j, k, l) + 2b (e, i)(?)
	(e, i) half-bar note type



COMPLETE:

build custom *.csv to *.txt converter
	C++ console app
	prompt bpm, start delay, etc.
	prompt excel *.csv
	convert to MRC (proprietary format)
	save as *.txt
