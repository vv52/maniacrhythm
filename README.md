## What is it?
Maniac Rhythm is a bemani-style rhythm game made in Unity utilizing techniques discussed by Yu Chao and Graham Tattersall on Gamasutra.

This project will utilize a four note button layout (equivalent to 4B style in DJMAX), with all music and visuals coming from projects by Vanja Venezia.

There will be selectable songs and difficulty levels as well as unreleased music made specifically for this game (if time allows).

## Goals
1. Four note lanes with fair judgement
2. Clean and appealing visuals
3. Audio reactive video backgrounds
4. Track selection
5. Difficulty selection

## Auxiliary Goals
1. 5B, 6B, 7B, or 8B mode
2. More music than the two songs planned
3. Ranking / leaderboards
